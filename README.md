# refactor-html-css


Criteria for this project is to refactor the code to have the html elements be semantic and to structure the CSS in a structured format.

The conditions are as followed below:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


HTML:
I changed majority of <div> tags to something more descriptive of the content that would be held inside. 

CSS:
I moved the order of some CSS element selectors so it flowed with how the HTML elements were in the index.html.
